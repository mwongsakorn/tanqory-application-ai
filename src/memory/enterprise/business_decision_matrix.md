## Speed vs Quality Matrix

### **Decision Framework**
```yaml
Speed_vs_Quality_Matrix:

  # High Speed Priority, Quality Acceptable
  speed_priority_high:
    criteria:
      - "Market window opportunity <90 days"
      - "Competitive threat requiring immediate response"
      - "Customer critical issue affecting >50% users"
      - "Regulatory deadline with penalties"

    decision_authority: "Product VP + Engineering VP"
    quality_floor: "Security standards, data integrity, core functionality"
    process: "Rapid prototyping → MVP → iterative improvement"
    timeline: "Decision within 24 hours, delivery within 2 weeks"

    examples:
      market_response:
        scenario: "Competitor launches similar feature gaining market share"
        decision: "Launch competitive feature with core functionality"
        quality_compromise: "Advanced features postponed, not core quality"
        success_metric: "Market share retention, feature adoption rate"

      customer_emergency:
        scenario: "Critical bug affecting majority of customers"
        decision: "Immediate hotfix with comprehensive solution to follow"
        quality_compromise: "Quick fix acceptable if root cause addressed later"
        success_metric: "Customer service restoration time"

  # Balanced Speed and Quality
  speed_quality_balanced:
    criteria:
      - "Standard product development cycle"
      - "Moderate competitive pressure"
      - "Customer request with flexible timeline"
      - "Internal efficiency improvement"

    decision_authority: "Product Manager + Tech Lead"
    quality_standards: "Full testing cycle, code review, documentation"
    process: "Standard development → QA → staged rollout"
    timeline: "Decision within 1 week, delivery within 6-8 weeks"

    examples:
      feature_enhancement:
        scenario: "Customer requests enhancement to existing feature"
        decision: "Full development cycle with user testing"
        quality_approach: "Comprehensive testing and gradual rollout"
        success_metric: "Feature quality score, customer satisfaction"

      process_optimization:
        scenario: "Internal process improvement opportunity"
        decision: "Balanced approach optimizing both speed and quality"
        quality_approach: "Pilot testing before full implementation"
        success_metric: "Process efficiency gain, error rate reduction"

  # Quality Priority, Speed Secondary
  quality_priority_high:
    criteria:
      - "Customer trust and safety implications"
      - "Long-term platform foundation changes"
      - "Security or compliance requirements"
      - "Brand reputation considerations"

    decision_authority: "CTO + relevant VP + CEO approval for brand impact"
    quality_standards: "Comprehensive testing, security audit, compliance validation"
    process: "Research → design → prototype → test → deploy"
    timeline: "Decision within 2 weeks, delivery timeline secondary to quality"

    examples:
      security_implementation:
        scenario: "New security framework implementation"
        decision: "Quality and security over speed"

        scenario: "Core platform architecture upgrade"
        decision: "Quality and stability paramount"
        quality_approach: "Extensive testing, gradual migration, rollback capability"
        success_metric: "System reliability improvement, technical debt reduction"

Escalation_Rules:
  quality_compromise_escalation:
    trigger: "Quality metrics fall below defined thresholds"
    escalation_to: "CTO + CEO"
    timeline: "Immediate notification, 24-hour response required"

  speed_delay_escalation:
    trigger: "Critical speed decisions delayed beyond acceptable timeline"
    escalation_to: "Relevant VP + CEO"
