## Core Memory Architecture

### **Core Memory System Design**
```yaml
Core Memory Structure:
  Purpose: Central repository of organizational intelligence and standards

  Directory Structure:
    /docs/memory/
      core/                    # Foundational standards (this document lives here)
        01_project_overview.md
        02_tanqory_vision.md
        03_core_api_standards.md
        04_core_security.md
        05_core_coding_standards.md
        06_core_documentation_style.md

      prompts/                 # AI prompt library
        core/                  # Core system prompts
        domain/                # Domain-specific prompts
        workflows/             # Process automation prompts

      standards/               # Technical and operational standards
        architecture/
        data/
        infrastructure/
        compliance/

      runbooks/               # Operational procedures
        incident-response/
        deployment/
        monitoring/
        troubleshooting/

Core Memory Principles:
  1. Single Source of Truth - Each concept documented once, referenced everywhere
  2. Hierarchical Organization - Information flows from general to specific
  3. Bidirectional Linking - Documents reference and are referenced by others
  4. Version Control - All changes tracked and attributable
  5. Role-Based Access - Information segmented by security clearance
  6. Continuous Validation - Content accuracy verified automatically
  7. Knowledge Extraction - Key insights surfaced and highlighted
  8. Decision Traceability - Rationale behind decisions documented
```

### **Document Metadata Standards**
```yaml
# Required frontmatter for all Core Memory documents

## Markdown Standards

### **Heading Structure**
```markdown
# Document Title (H1 - Only one per document)

> **Core Memory**: Brief description of document purpose and scope

## Major Section (H2)

### Subsection (H3)

#### Detail Section (H4)

##### Implementation Detail (H5)

###### Code Comment Level (H6 - Rarely used)
```

### **Text Formatting Standards**
```markdown
# Text Emphasis Rules

**Important concepts** - Bold for key terms and critical information
*Emphasis* - Italics for slight emphasis or foreign terms
`code snippets` - Backticks for inline code, commands, or technical terms
~~deprecated~~ - Strikethrough for outdated information (with migration note)

# Lists

## Ordered Lists (for processes, steps, priorities)
1. First step - always include action verb
2. Second step - be specific and actionable
3. Third step - include expected outcome

## Unordered Lists (for features, options, examples)
- Feature or concept
- Another feature
- Final feature

## Task Lists (for checklists and requirements)
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Pending task
- [ ] Future task

# Code and Technical Content

## Inline Code
Use `backticks` for:
- File names: `config.json`
- Commands: `npm install`
- Variables: `API_KEY`
- Technical terms: `MongoDB`

## Code Blocks
```typescript
// Always specify language for syntax highlighting
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
}
```

## Configuration Examples
```yaml
# YAML for configuration files
database:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  name: tanqory_db
```

```json
{
  "description": "JSON for API examples",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js"
}
```
```

### **Link Standards**
```markdown
# Internal Links (within Core Memory)
[API Standards](03_core_api_standards.md) - Relative paths only
[Security Guidelines](04_core_security.md#authentication) - With anchors

# External Links
[TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) - Always use descriptive text

# Reference Links (for repeated URLs)
This is a [reference link][typescript-docs] that can be reused.

[typescript-docs]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/ "TypeScript Official Documentation"

# File Downloads
[Download Template](./templates/api-template.yaml) - Include file extension in description

### **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**
```markdown
# ADR-001: Use TypeScript for All New Backend Services

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - 2025-09-16

## Decision Makers
- CTO: John Smith
- Lead Backend Engineer: Jane Doe
- Platform Architecture Team

## Context
We need to choose a primary language for new backend services. Current codebase is mixed JavaScript and TypeScript, causing maintenance challenges and type safety issues.

## Decision
All new backend services will be implemented in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled.

## Rationale

### Advantages
- **Type Safety**: Reduces runtime errors by 60% (measured across existing TypeScript services)
- **Developer Experience**: Better IDE support, autocompletion, and refactoring
- **Maintainability**: Self-documenting code with interface definitions
- **Team Onboarding**: Easier for new developers to understand codebase
- **Tooling**: Superior debugging and testing capabilities

### Disadvantages
- **Learning Curve**: 2-week training period for JavaScript-only developers
- **Build Complexity**: Additional compilation step in development workflow
- **Migration Effort**: Existing JavaScript services require gradual migration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: New Services (Immediate)
- All new services use TypeScript with strict configuration
- Shared type definitions in `@tanqory/types` package
- Updated development tooling and CI/CD pipelines

### Phase 2: Migration (6 months)
- Convert critical JavaScript services to TypeScript
- Priority based on maintenance burden and error frequency
- Team training and knowledge transfer sessions

### Phase 3: Completion (12 months)
- All services converted to TypeScript
- Remove JavaScript-specific tooling and configurations
- Update documentation and best practices

## Success Metrics
- Reduce production errors by 40% within 6 months
- Improve developer onboarding time by 30%
- Achieve 95% type coverage across all services
- Maintain or improve current development velocity

## Monitoring
- Monthly review of error rates and developer satisfaction
- Quarterly assessment of migration progress
- Annual review of decision effectiveness

## Related Decisions
- ADR-002: TypeScript Configuration Standards
- ADR-003: Shared Type Library Architecture
- ADR-004: JavaScript to TypeScript Migration Strategy
