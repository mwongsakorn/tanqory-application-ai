## üèóÔ∏è Repository Architecture Strategy

### **Repository Organization**

#### **Backend Microservices: Multi-repo approach**
```bash
# ‚úÖ One microservice = One repository
catalog-api/                    # Product catalog service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json               # npm for single service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile

user-api/                      # User management service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json               # npm for single service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile

order-api/                     # Order processing service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json               # npm for single service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
```
**Rationale**: Independent deployment, team ownership, service isolation

#### **Frontend Platforms: Monorepo approach**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Multiple platforms in single repository
tanqory-platform/               # Frontend monorepo
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pnpm-workspace.yaml        # pnpm for monorepo
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @tanqory/ui-components/ # Shared UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @tanqory/api-client/    # API client
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @tanqory/shared-utils/  # Utilities
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ @tanqory/design-tokens/ # Design system
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web-app/               # Next.js web application
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mobile-app/            # React Native application
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ desktop-app/           # Electron application
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ admin-dashboard/       # Admin interface
```
**Rationale**: Shared UI components, unified state management, atomic releases

#### **Shared Libraries: Monorepo with pnpm workspaces**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Cross-platform shared libraries
tanqory-sdk/                   # SDK monorepo
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pnpm-workspace.yaml       # pnpm for monorepo
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @tanqory/core-business/    # Business logic
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @tanqory/api-client/       # API communication
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @tanqory/auth-sdk/         # Authentication
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @tanqory/payment-sdk/      # Payment processing
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ @tanqory/analytics-sdk/    # Analytics tracking
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ @tanqory/dev-tools/        # Development utilities
```
**Rationale**: Version synchronization, easier refactoring, shared tooling

#### **Infrastructure: Dedicated repositories per domain**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Infrastructure separation
tanqory-infrastructure/        # Terraform, K8s configs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json              # npm for infrastructure tools
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kubernetes/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helm-charts/

tanqory-cicd-pipelines/       # CI/CD configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json              # npm for pipeline tools
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ github-actions/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ azure-pipelines/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment-scripts/
```
**Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns, different team ownership

### **Monorepo vs Multi-repo Decision Matrix**
```yaml
Use_Monorepo_When:
  - Shared code dependencies (UI components, utilities)
  - Coordinated releases required (frontend platforms)
  - Same team maintains multiple related packages
  - Atomic changes across multiple packages needed

Use_Multi_repo_When:
  - Independent service lifecycle (microservices)
  - Different team ownership and responsibility
  - Independent deployment schedules
  - Service isolation and security boundaries required
```

> **Hybrid Strategy**: Selective use of monorepo for shared code, multi-repo for microservices. Best of both approaches based on use case.
